                        11. Which of the following factors affect transmission rate in DSL? <br>
                        a) The gauge of the twisted-pair line <br>
                        b) Degree of electrical interfernece <br>
                        c) Shadow fading <br>
                        d) The gauge of the twisted-pair line and degree of electrical interference <br>
                        <br>
                        Answer: d <br>
                        Explanation: <br> Because DSL is made of twisted wire copper pair, the gauge of twisted pair line i.e. the protection and electrical interference would affect the transmission rate in DSL. <br> Unlike DSL, FTTP is not really affected by these factors.
